# itcy-tui

Terminal for **ITCy**, Interchouette ITC's AI LinkedIn operator.

Built with [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/). One chrome, four views:

- **Publications (`p`):** public GitHub trees for [itcy-publications](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/itcy-publications) (org and fork; `drafts`, `posts`, `drafts_tweet`, `tweets`). Works with no ITCy process.
- **Live (`d`):** when the [ITCy](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/itcy) binary is up, probes `GET /health` and `GET /status`.
- **Commands (`c`):** slash catalog. Enter on `/list` loads saved drafts when the product is up.
- **Saved list (`s`):** `/list` table. Needs the live product.

## Run

```bash
make test
make run
```

ITCy does not need to be running. If product `/health` is down, the browser opens on publications. If it is up, you land on live; press `p` for publications.

Optional: `ITCY_HEALTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4700/health make run`

Quit with `q` or Ctrl-C. `Esc` never quits: it closes `/` filter, `:` command, or help.

## What you see

**Commands:** slash table. Click selects; Enter on `/list` loads saved drafts when ITCy is up. Other rows are reference.

**Saved list:** id, status, subject from `/list`. Empty when the product is down.
